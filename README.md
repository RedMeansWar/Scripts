# Disclaimer
My code is free to use and can be modified as much as you want. If you make a script  and you take my code or use some of my files (e.g. Common.Client) please give me credit for the parts that I coded.

If you want to use the code to understand NUI better as I know there isn't a lot of documentation on it, especially if you're using C# with NUI.

# CHAT
If you are using the chat that I made please delete the default FiveM chat and the chat-theme-gtao folder that can be found in this folder:
```
resources/[gameplay]/chat
resources/[gameplay]/chat-theme-gtao
```

There is a downside with my chat and that is you have to add the suggestions manually because it reads from a Json file and it was the fastest way that I can get the chat done. The html files was taken from Yuvalino's chat that can be found [here](https://github.com/yuvalino/main-chat/tree/master/html).
